================================== 
   ROBOT      BASKET     WASHER
 
Program this robot to wash your baskets of clothes!
 
Your clothes are in a basket, which is the same as an array in coding terms!
 
The robot can use a function called putItemInWash() for one item, or 
putPileInWash() for a whole basket!
 
Use pseudo code for this - you do NOT have to code it up! This excercise is about
the procblem solving side of programming, so we're not worried about syntax.
 
Think of the tools we have as programmers while you are problem solving, such as:
	
	- Foreach loops
	- If and else statements
	- Adding items to an array, which in this case could be a basket of clothes!
	- We can call other functions (like putItemInWash), and for this excercise 
	  you don't have to write them.
 
 
LEVEL 1
 
Tell the robot to wash your whole basket of clothes at once!
 
=================// YOUR PSEUDO CODE HERE! \\=====================================
 
 Use putBasketInWash on basket
 putBasketInWash($basket)
 
 
 
==================================================================================
 
LEVEL 2
 
Tell the robot to go through each item in your clothes basket, and for each one,
use a function called checkPockets(). Then put the item in the wash.
 
=================// YOUR PSEUDO CODE HERE! \\=====================================
 
 foreach item in basket
  checkPockets($item)
  putItemInWash($item)
 
 
==================================================================================
 
 
LEVEL 3
 
Tell the robot you want the items sorted into colored and white items, then washed 
in separate washes. It will need to make two new baskets, and go through the clothes 
and put them in the correct color basket, then wash that basket.
 
=================// YOUR PSEUDO CODE HERE! \\=====================================
 
Get basket for white clothes:
$whiteBasket = array()

 foreach item in basket 
  checkPockets(item)
  checkItemColour(item)
  if()  white {
    put in white basket
     $whitebasket[] = $item;
  }
  else {
    put in coloured basket
      $colouredbasket[] = $item;
  }

  putBasketInWash($whiteBasket)
  putBasketInWash($colouredBasket)
 
 
 
==================================================================================
 
LEVEL 4
 
Now you want to wash the clothes by each color group. Tell the robot to go through
each item, and check its color. It might need to start a new basket for that color
or add it to an existing basket. Then it needs to wash each basket separately.
 
=================// YOUR PSEUDO CODE HERE! \\=====================================

Check $colour of item
  check if there is a basket with that colour
    if there is, add the item to that basket,
    "$color"basket[] = $item;
    if there isn't, assign a new basket to that colour.

    for each basket
    put basket in wash
